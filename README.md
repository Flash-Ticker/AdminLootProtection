**Features**
This plugin prevents players from looting admins and specified groups. 

*We are RustFlash one of the most popular German modded servers. We have many custom extensions and I would like to share them with you!
If you are looking for a server yourself, we welcome you to join us.*

It checks if the looter has a specific permission ("adminlootprotection.use"), and if not, it restricts them from looting players who are admins. You can also extend this to protect other specific groups or conditions.

In summary, it adds a layer of protection for admins and certain groups to prevent unauthorized looting by other players. 


 

**Functions**

Give the respective group on your server the appropriate permission to avoid being looted:

```adminlootprotection.use```
